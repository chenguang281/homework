Lecture-03 Gradient Descent and Dymanic Programming
In this week, we need complete following tasks:

Re-review the course online programming;
Choose 1 - 2 books which you interested and keep reading;
Answer the review questions
Prepare the basic requirement of our 1st project.
Part I Review the online programming.
Part 2: change loss function from $loss = \frac{1}{n}\sum{(y_i - \hat(y_i))^2}$ to $loss = \frac{1}{n}\sum{|y_i - \hat{y_i}|}$, and using your mathmatical knowledge to get the right partial formual. Implemen the gradient descent code.
Part 3: Finish the Solution Parse Part of Edit-Distance

Part 5-1: review machine learning
Why do we use Derivative / Gredient to fit a target function?¶
Ans:

In the words 'Gredient Descent', what's the Gredient and what's the Descent?¶
Ans:

What's the advantages of the 3rd gradient descent method compared to the previous methods?
Ans:

Using the simple words to describe: What's the machine leanring.¶
Ans:

Part 5: Answer following questions:
Why do we need dynamic programming? What's the difference of dynamic programming and previous talked search problme?
Why do we still need dynamic programming? Why not we train a machine learning to fit a function which could get the right answer based on inputs?
Can you catch up at least 3 problems which could solved by Dynamic Programming?
Can you catch up at least 3 problems wich could sloved by Edit Distance?
Please summarize the three main features of Dynamic Programming, and make a concise explain for each feature.
What's the disadvantages of Dynamic Programming? (You may need search by yourself in Internet)
Part 6 Preparation of Project-01
Using python Flask or Bottle to finish your first simple web app:

https://bottlepy.org/

Learn what's the SQL, and try some simple SQL operations:

Learn what's the HTML ( ONLY need to know the basic things)

https://getbootstrap.com/; https://www.w3schools.com/html/


(Optinal) Finish the k-person-salesman problem:
In [7]:
import random
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
In [8]:
latitudes = [random.randint(-100, 100) for _ in range(20)]
longitude = [random.randint(-100, 100) for _ in range(20)]
In [9]:
plt.scatter(latitudes, longitude)

给定一个初始点 𝑃, 已经 𝑘个车辆，如何从该点出发，经这 k 个车辆经过所以的点全部一次，而且所走过的路程最短?
